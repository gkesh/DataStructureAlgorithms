# DataStructureAlgorithms
A few sorting and hashing algorithms implemented in Java. All implementations are functional and can be used for educational purposes for those who are interested.

It contains:
1. Bubble Sort
2. Insertion Sort
3. Merge Sort
4. Quick Sort
5. Selection Sort
6. Double Hashing
7. Quadrate Probing
8. Single Linked List
9. Circular Linked List
10. BruteForce Knapsack

And I don't know why i included a knapsack algorithm in there. Just Roll with it.
